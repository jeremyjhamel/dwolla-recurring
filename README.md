# dwolla-recurring-heroku
A quickstart tutorial application written in Rails 4 + bootstrap to illustrate recurring transactions in the Dwolla API.

![Ooh! Pretty!](http://puu.sh/htYFn/1d9afd6b3e.png)

## Requirements
- Rails 4+
- Bundler

This application does not require any database access as all the data is processed via the Dwolla API. ActiveRecord has been removed from this project. 

## Getting Started

### The easy way

The default application key and secret bundled with the application are for you to use with the UAT environment, so you can just run it!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mach-kernel/dwolla-recurring-heroku.git
cd dwolla-recurring-heroku
bundle install && rails s
```

Afterwards, just visit your default Rails URL, which is probably `localhost:3000`.

### Hurt me plenty

Just kidding. The only thing that you would really need to configure are the `dwolla-ruby` variables. You can find everything that you need in `config/initializers/dwollavars.rb`

```ruby
require 'dwolla'

module DwollaVars
	mattr_reader  :Dwolla, :redirect

	@@key ||= "OFvc0S1ccEhgI/qJleEsIQQBdb3/mReQMkaNQmFbbo8PaAAtYI"
	@@secret ||= "oi6jXUSXVN1MuB0YT6X5WV/Alhv9MZdtDLSd71h6HOLRpu6fSf"

	@@redirect ||= "http://localhost:3000/dashboard/handle_oauth"

	@@Dwolla ||= Dwolla
	@@Dwolla::api_key ||= @@key
	@@Dwolla::api_secret ||= @@secret
	@@Dwolla::sandbox ||= true
end
```

**Note**: These values cannot be edited on-the-fly (except from within a `rails c` session) and require a restart of the rails server. 

## Deploy to Heroku

Heroku is in the name of the repo, right?

### Requirements

- A [Heroku](https://heroku.com) account with an available instance.
- The [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed to your local machine (and added to your `%PATH%` variable if you are a Windows user).
- I recommend forking this repository so that you can have write privileges. 

### How-to

1. Log in
```bash
heroku login

Enter your Heroku credentials.
Email: you@example.com
Password:
Could not find an existing public key.
Would you like to generate one? [Yn]
Generating new SSH public key.
Uploading ssh public key /Users/david/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

2. Install Rails
```bash
gem install rails
```

3. Add the Heroku Gem to this project

I would have done this for you, but this is more fun!

```bash
echo "gem 'rails_12factor'" >> Gemfile
bundle install
```

4. Drop back to your local machine's shell and change to the application directory

This will add a heroku branch to the git repository

```bash
heroku create
Creating dwolla-rails-heroku... done, stack is cedar-14
https://dwolla-rails-heroku.herokuapp.com/ | https://git.heroku.com/dwolla-rails-heroku.git
Git remote heroku added
```

And finally, deploy and run.

```bash
git push heroku master
heroku ps:scale web=1
```

That wasn't so bad, was it?
